### Day 1: December 01, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Introduction Programs of C++ in Hackerrank.

**Thoughts:** After 2 years of working on Python, I gave myself a good opportunity to learn C++, now I am pretty much familiar with the basic syntax and implementation of basic concepts of C++.
